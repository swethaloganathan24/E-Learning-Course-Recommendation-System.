Which I find important but incomplete. I had the hardest time going through the lectures and  the book of  Peter Fader. Although the idea is interesting, these lectures were much less focused on their actual research. Nore could he present many positive role models from the real world. Rather, it felt like a call for a religious type of belief where you should trust that companies who don't do this are doomed and only those companies who fully immerse themselves into this approach will succeed in the future.

html,Introduction to HTML5,4.0,"Professor Marc van Oostendorp has woven a lovely and living web of an introduction/refresher to Linguistics for anyone with the beginning of a serious interest. His enthusiasm and outright love of the discipline are infectious and are filtered by an evident and generous humanity.  This works especially well in his choice of guest speakers who are without exception a joy to hear.  He ties it all together at the end with William Labov's wonderful retrospective, showing the student that one doesn't have to be a follower of a particular school of thought to appreciate how its proponents generously pour their discipline, experience, skills, love and humanity into what they are doing.  In so doing they, as well as the good Professor, share the essential lesson:  approach language with all the scientific discipline you can muster but always keep in mind that it is something human, mysterious and very much alive, and always changing.  Something that cannot be caged.Why only two stars? One star off for each of the following:First, it is too light and the required readings too short and too easy.  Furthermore, there is an over focus on certain topics, especially politeness theory and speech errors, which doesn't really go anywhere.  Other topics, such as approaches to syntactical analysis, cognitive linguistics, etc. could well be further explored.Next, the structure of student participation should be enhanced to require much more lateral work (of better quality) among and between students currently taking the course.  Much of the recent input was appallingly poor, leaving one with the impression that participants where just ticking boxes.  Finally, and most importantly, is the failure of the course on this commercial platform.  The student receives many emails urging the purchase of a certificate or of other courses, but the course itself is not kept properly updated.  It contains many errors that have not been corrected for quite some time.  Most are not very important, but some, including a few patently incorrect quiz and exam answers (which have been cited and admitted in the Forum but not changed), are important.  The student has, in effect, no way to check where s/he might have gone wrong.  The student gets no up-to-date feedback.    The course was free, a kind of teaser for the commercial product, but that gives Coursera all the more reason to keep it updated, to keep on improving it.  One gets the impression, as things now stand, that Coursera cares about the money a little too much.  That it has  missed the balance between the search for profit and the search for meaning.

Prior to this course, my coding background was JavaScript, jQuery, and SQL.  I have never used UE4 and I have never learned C++.  So I started with your Introduction to C++ before I started this course and I highly recommend doing that.  From what I have seen in comparison to what is out there, you do a very good job of explaining in detail everything that is happening all the time, which is hard to do.  You also take the time to show resources and how to read through the Unreal documentation which I am still learning how to do.  I remember you saying something like, """"""""It never really makes sense"", but the more you read it, the more you see it,"" the more it will start to make sense eventually.""""""""  Another fun fact: this class was based on UE version 4.19 and I decided to have fun and build with 4.22.2"", which then later updated to 4.22.3 all while I was taking this course.  Let's just say after the 50% marker all H E double L broke loose and it really tested my knowledge on how to fix problems.  I understand there is a great community out there, especially for problem solving discussions, but the truth is, I wanted to test my skill and use what I learned here.  Long story short,"" I was able to think through my problems logically and solve them on my own.  Even the worst of issues didn't take more than a night or two of sleep for me to realize what the problem was and how to fix it.  One of the hardest things in programming is getting away from the """"""""tutorial-vice-grip"""""""" but this course"", and this instructor, really set the foundation to truly learn and understand the material.

I especially liked how sometimes the labs would purposely use incorrect code which users might enter, and then explain why that code didn't apply or work for given scenarios.  I liked how the videos (specifically regarding Canada dataset) would repeat the cleansing of the data and introduction of the data for each type of plot because it really reinforced the concept, however it could have been better if the corresponding code were displayed alongside its effects instead of just showing its effects because then it would drive home the code and the concept instead of just the concept.I also liked the fact that the final project asked students to make connections beyond the individual class scope, as a way of teaching that mimics real-world projects and learning.",Coursera,1,"['course', 'really', 'well', 'designed', 'taken', 'preceding', 'course', 'really', 'connected', 'format', 'course', 'liked', 'lab', 'really', 'explored', 'different', 'option', 'played', 'around', 'code', 'variety', 'way', 'show', 'complete', 'picture', 'code', 'instance', 'especially', 'liked', 'sometimes', 'lab', 'would', 'purposely', 'use', 'incorrect', 'code', 'user', 'might', 'enter', 'explain', 'code', 'apply', 'work', 'given', 'scenario', 'liked', 'video', 'specifically', 'regarding', 'canada', 'dataset', 'would', 'repeat', 'cleansing', 'data', 'introduction', 'data', 'type', 'plot', 'really', 'reinforced', 'concept', 'however', 'could', 'better', 'corresponding', 'code', 'displayed', 'alongside', 'effect', 'instead', 'showing', 'effect', 'would', 'drive', 'home', 'code', 'concept', 'instead', 'concept', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'final', 'project', 'asked', 'student', 'make', 'connection', 'beyond', 'individual', 'class', 'scope', 'way', 'teaching', 'mimic', 'real', 'world', 'project', 'learning']",course really well designed taken preceding course really connected format course liked lab really explored different option played around code variety way show complete picture code instance especially liked sometimes lab would purposely use incorrect code user might enter explain code apply work given scenario liked video specifically regarding canada dataset would repeat cleansing data introduction data type plot really reinforced concept however could better corresponding code displayed alongside effect instead showing effect would drive home code concept instead concept also liked fact final project asked student make connection beyond individual class scope way teaching mimic real world project learning,Positive

introduction-psychology,Introduction to Psychology,5.0,"
Hello. I enrolled in this course with the 7-day free trial. I found the 
lessons interesting and the writing exercises challenging. I did not continue, however, because I don't feel I was learning if I was learning. I liked reading others' work and being able to share an opinion about it, and I enjoyed the peer review feedback.

I felt slightly challenged but never overwhelmed which is a good place to be when you're learning something new. It has given me a lot of confidence to be able to hack my way through starting an app from scratch, develop it and finally deploy it on my own server if I want. I know my own knowledge as it stands still isn't solid enough to do it straight up, but I have the tools now and I know where to look to work it out and do it on my own. The only reason I didn't give a full five stars is because a lot of the course material was fairly outdated at the time I came to it.
